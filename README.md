# Sonakinatography I, Composition III (1970)
## An Algorithm by Channa Horwitz

> I have created a visual philosophy by working with deductive logic. I had a need to control and compose time as I had controlled and composed two-dimensional drawings and paintings.

~ Channa Horwitz *Art Flash* (1976)

# Run

- To run:
    - `python -c "import sonakinatography; sonakinatography.run_full(x)"`
    - Where `x` is the number of iterations the algorithm undertakes. A recommended starting point is `75`.
- Saved as `sonakinatography.svg` in the same director as `sonakinatography.py`.
